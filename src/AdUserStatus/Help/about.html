      <h2>About ADUserStatus</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>ADUserStatus</strong> is a lightweight Windows desktop tool that helps administrators and/or service owners to quickly assess user account status against Active Directory from a spreadsheet or text-based input list. It provides immediate visibility into which accounts are enabled, disabled, not found, or external.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application is designed for internal administrative use, requiring no special installation privileges and using integrated Windows authentication to connect securely to domain controllers.
